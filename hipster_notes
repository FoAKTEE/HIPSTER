Bispectrum:
- Currently storing all nearby separations and angles -> faster to analyze each separately? There's O(100-1000) of them.
- How do we do normalization? x 6 or not? + Check with i<j<k thing
- Indexing in RRR file has each ell in separate column and n^2 radial bins
NB: some of the one-grid utilities in the group_counter script will fail for non-equal fields.
- We can probably pre-allocate memory to registers for speed in bisecptrum_counts
- Could remove bispoectrum code from grid_power.cpp file?
- RRR counts correctly give Wa*Wb*delta_{ell,0}. (No other normalization)
- Can test DDD by comparing DDD and RRR with random catalog
- There's a weird malloc error going on...
- Seems like the make_map function isn't being called??

NEW ROUTINE
- Have two nearby cell lists - and iterate over first then second with different routines
- Note we currently have ONLY particles below R0

Still To Do:
- Only need to store values for a<=b;
- Should we stop counting both i<j and i>j? Not sure how kernels respond to this
- Remove testing output files, e.g. DDR_I,II
- Maybe more accurate to switch to gsl qag integration rather than summing
- Maybe add more integration steps to internal integrals in E_II kernel
- Why is second part of the integration kernel so slow??
- Make routine for particles where cellsep > R0 always - i.e. avoid other routine
- Clean up parameter file
- Sort out compilation errors when PERIODIC not specified
- Should speed up j0 computation somehow, + reorder arrays in integral
- Have checked E_II kernel against Python + is consistent.
- Clean up MAKEFILE
- Should add R0 to file names - also do in power spectrum?
- Should multithread integration kernels
- Should the kernel_interps be shared or used on each core? test!
- Remove MAXORDER in file?
- Could autoset fields 2 + 3 if unspecified?

To Do with Pk etc.:
- Test subsampling behavior
- Test covariance with mocks + R0
- Analytic Gaussian covariance
- Discuss actual algorithm for Bispectrum
- Can we deconvolve?? - would just be better to measure 2PCF here!!
