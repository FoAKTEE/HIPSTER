Bispectrum:
- Currently storing all nearby separations and angles -> faster to analyze each separately? There's O(100-1000) of them.
NB: some of the one-grid utilities in the group_counter script will fail for non-equal fields.
- We can probably pre-allocate memory to registers for speed in bisecptrum_counts
- Could remove bispoectrum code from grid_power.cpp file?
- There's a weird malloc error going on...
- Seems like the make_map function isn't being called??

It might actually be faster to run with a random catalog for the D-R-D term with R in the center
Need to remove E_II_interpolators

Now removing option to generate particles randomly

Still To Do:
- Sort out all the output + number of counts etc.
- Relook at input options
- Test how many randoms we need
- Fully remove a<b in interpolators
- Should we stop counting both i<j and i>j? Not sure how kernels respond to this
- Remove testing output files, e.g. DDR_I,II
- Clean up parameter file
- must check we havent screwed up Pk
- Remove phi file from bisepctrum and parameters
- Sort out compilation errors when PERIODIC not specified
- Clean up MAKEFILE
- Should add R0 to file names - also do in power spectrum?
- Should multithread integration kernels
- Should the kernel_interps be shared or used on each core? test!
- Remove MAXORDER in file?
- Note we only need 1 field now

To Do with Pk etc.:
- Test subsampling behavior
- Test covariance with mocks + R0
- Analytic Gaussian covariance
- Discuss actual algorithm for Bispectrum
- Can we deconvolve?? - would just be better to measure 2PCF here!!
