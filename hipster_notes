Notes:
- We choose axis as the z-axis here (fixed for simulation) (though can be changed relatively easily)
- Now ell up to 6 implemented
- Periodicity can now be enabled from makefile at command line
- We ignore weights in periodic running
- Remove -9.1 in Makefile
- Now outputs entire power spectrum in C++ file
- To run on Mac need gcc + gnu-getopt
- usual wrapper currently broken
- removed suffices from counts
- note there's no aliasing - v important
- note that we can add odd monopoles if necessary
- Note file names for periodic + aperiodic - removed `full`
- To test validity; compute halo Pk from 100 Quijote sims - with subsampling and different R0 -> get to see errors!

To Do:
- We should remove periodic option from the usual wrapper
- Preload interpolation grid?
- Rewrite README
- Update docs
- add aperiodic subsampling
- Must check normal wrapper still works
- Remove periodicity in Phi correction entirely?
- Note that subsampling is good for testing + on-the-fly estimates. Would be better to properly subsample + keep files else.

To Test:
Periodic power mode
Aperiodic counts (to check we haven't broken it)
