Notes:
- We choose axis as the z-axis here (fixed for simulation) (though can be changed relatively easily)
- Now ell up to 6 implemented
- Periodicity can now be enabled from makefile at command line
- We ignore weights in periodic running

To Do:
- Removed functionality for periodic correction function - must compute in C++ file.
- We should remove periodic option from the usual wrapper
- Preload interpolation grid?
- Can we get rid of Phi file entirely if periodic? - no this stores normalization information
- Must create reconstruct_power_periodic.py file
- Update to ell=6
- Test if the periodic makefile hack works
- Check if it works with no weights supplied

To Test:
Periodic power mode
Aperiodic counts (to check we haven't broken it)
