Bispectrum:
- Currently storing all nearby separations and angles -> faster to analyze each separately? There's O(100-1000) of them.
NB: some of the one-grid utilities in the group_counter script will fail for non-equal fields.
- We can probably pre-allocate memory to registers for speed in bisecptrum_counts
- Could remove bispectrum code from grid_power.cpp file?
- There's a weird malloc error going on...
- Seems like the make_map function isn't being called??

Still To Do:
- Sort out all the output + number of counts etc.
- Test how many randoms we need
- Remove testing output files, e.g. DDR_I,II
- Remove MAXORDER in file?
- read and check documentation

To Do with Pk etc.:
- Test subsampling behavior
- Test covariance with mocks + R0
- Analytic Gaussian covariance
- Discuss actual algorithm for Bispectrum
- Can we deconvolve?? - would just be better to measure 2PCF here!!
