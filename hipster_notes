Bispectrum:
- Currently storing all nearby separations and angles -> faster to analyze each separately? There's O(100-1000) of them.
- How do we do normalization? x 6 or not? + Check with i<j<k thing
- Indexing in RRR file has each ell in separate column and n^2 radial bins
NB: some of the one-grid utilities in the group_counter script will fail for non-equal fields.
NB: This is horribly inefficient currently. Can pre-compute lots of quantities in bisepctrum kernel.
- We can probably pre-allocate memory to registers for speed in bisecptrum_counts
- used_triples actually holds pairs... check this + relabel?

- Currently computing DDD term in full (except normalization and factor of 6(-1)^ell etc.) -> includes A_lm*A_lm - C_l here

Still To Do:
- Implement DDR in pair counts - can we do this with R separation on 2 legs?
- Implement RRR in C++
- Add in (-1)^ell factor to DDD counts
- Reduce number of bins by symmetry of k1->k2?
- Many factors missing; e.g. in outer-product kernel sum; restricting to n2<n requires symmetrization and x2

To Do with Pk etc.:
- Test subsampling behavior
- Test covariance with mocks + R0
- Analytic Gaussian covariance
- Discuss actual algorithm for Bispectrum
- Can we deconvolve?? - would just be better to measure 2PCF here!!
