Notes:
- We choose axis as the z-axis here (fixed for simulation) (though can be changed relatively easily)
- Now ell up to 6 implemented
- Periodicity can now be enabled from makefile at command line
- We ignore weights in periodic running
- Remove -9.1 in Makefile
- Now outputs entire power spectrum in C++ file
- To run on Mac need gcc + gnu-getopt
- usual wrapper currently broken
- removed suffices from counts
- Note file names for periodic

To Do:
- Removed functionality for periodic correction function - must compute in C++ file.
- We should remove periodic option from the usual wrapper
- Preload interpolation grid?
- Rewrite README
- Update docs

To Test:
Periodic power mode
Aperiodic counts (to check we haven't broken it)
