Notes:
- We choose axis as the z-axis here (fixed for simulation) (though can be changed relatively easily)


To Do:
- Removed functionality for periodic correction function - must compute in C++ file.
- We should remove periodic option from the usual wrapper
- Preload interpolation grid?
- Can we get rid of Phi file entirely if periodic? - no this stores normalization information
- Must create reconstruct_power_periodic.py file
