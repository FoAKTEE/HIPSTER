Bispectrum:
- Currently storing all nearby separations and angles -> faster to analyze each separately? There's O(100-1000) of them.
NB: some of the one-grid utilities in the group_counter script will fail for non-equal fields.
- We can probably pre-allocate memory to registers for speed in bisecptrum_counts
- Could remove bispectrum code from grid_power.cpp file?
- There's a weird malloc error going on...
- Seems like the make_map function isn't being called??

Still To Do:
- Sort out all the output + number of counts etc.
- Test how many randoms we need
- Remove testing output files, e.g. DDR_I,II
- Remove MAXORDER in file?
- read and check documentation
- wrapper for bispectrum seems to want integer f_rand
- have fixed high-ell problem in bispectrum from fraction argument being too small.
  - also set interpolators to return minimum value if below minimum
  - change same in power spectrum??
- also doesn't recognize output file (maybe with decimal place in R0?)
- same for hipster_periodic script (even without decimals)

ARE WE IN REAL SPACE OR REDSHIFT SPACE??? quijote_halos_$sim is in RSD

To Do with Pk etc.:
- Note we're in real-space for B(k) but redshift space for P(k)
- Test subsampling behavior
- Test covariance with mocks + R0
- Analytic Gaussian covariance
- Discuss actual algorithm for Bispectrum


PAPER TO DO
- Bispectrum covariance?
- Look at ell dependence with mu = 1? i.e. k = 0??
